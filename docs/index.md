## Your Reading, Intelligently Curated

Imagine opening your RSS reader and seeing **exactly what matters**—not buried under hundreds of duplicates, promotional fluff, or yesterday's news. No endless scrolling. No FOMO. Just the stories you actually want to read.

**That's RSSMonster.**

## The Problem with Traditional RSS Readers

You subscribe to 50 feeds. The same breaking story appears in 15 of them. Promotional content sneaks through. Clickbait competes with long-form journalism. Everything fights for your attention in a never-ending chronological stream.

**You end up skimming everything and reading nothing.**

## How RSSMonster Is Different

### 🧠 **It Understands Your Content**

RSSMonster doesn't just collect articles—it reads them. It evaluates quality, identifies duplicates, and learns which sources you trust. Every article gets scored on what matters: writing quality, originality, and whether it's actually worth your time.

### 🎯 **You See What Matters First**

Instead of "newest first," RSSMonster ranks by **importance**. Breaking news from multiple trusted sources? Top of your list. Duplicate coverage? Clustered together and shown once. Promotional spam? Filtered out or ranked low automatically.

### 📂 **Smart Folders Do The Work For You**

Create views that adapt automatically:
- **"Top Stories Today"** — what's breaking and why it matters
- **"Worth Your Time"** — high-quality deep dives, no fluff
- **"Quick Scan"** — your daily overview, summarized
- **"Low Noise Mode"** — maximum signal, zero spam

Each Smart Folder is a living query. New content flows in; irrelevant content stays out.

### 🔍 **Search Like You Think**

Ask for what you want, naturally:
- `title:javascript @today quality:>0.7`
- `unread:true cluster:true sort:IMPORTANCE`
- Or just: *"Show me tech articles from last week"*

No complex syntax to memorize. RSSMonster speaks your language.
