When proposing new logic of building controllers, don't make any assumptions. If uncertain, first ask the user for sharing any existing code, models or controllers. I prefer compact single-expression assignments. Preserve existing comments when making changes.

- Backend is **Express using ESM only**
- Frontend is **Vue**, following existing project conventions
- Frontend uses **Bootstrap 5** for styling and layout. No alternative CSS frameworks. Bootstrap Icons are standard.
- ORM is **Sequelize with factory-style models**
